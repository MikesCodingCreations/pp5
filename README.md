## Design Choices
<details>
<summary>Design Choices</summary>
  
### Colors

We didn't pick our website colors by accident! Every shade is carefully chosen to resonate with you, our fitness-focused audience. The palette evokes a sense of health, vitality, and energy – just like the feeling you get after a great workout. But it's not all about excitement – we've also balanced it with professional and trustworthy tones to create a visually appealing and inviting atmosphere you can rely on.
- **#FEFEFE(White)** 
- **#182C2A(Neon Green)** 
- **#000(Black)** 
  
<strong>Seamless Navigation, Energised Design:</strong> This cohesive color scheme creates a visually-appealing and user-friendly interface. It will guide you effortlessly through our fitness products, empowering you to confidently take the first step towards a healthier, fitter you.

### Typography
<strong>Fonts That Fit Your Fitness Goals:</strong>
Just like our design, the fonts on the PureProteinPowders website are chosen with purpose. We use a modern, clean primary font **Lato** that ensures easy reading on any device, whether you're browsing on your desktop or checking us out on the go. Headings are clear and attention-grabbing, guiding you through the content effortlessly. And to make sure you never miss a call to action, buttons and important elements use slightly larger, stand-out fonts.

### Images
- **Hero image:** 
- **Logo:** Our logo starts with **Pure,** instantly conveying the power and energy you get from our products. They're designed to fuel your fitness journey and support overall well-being.  **Protein Powders** makes our focus clear – top-quality protein to help you build muscle, recover faster, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

### Favicon
<strong>A Tiny Icon, Big Impact:</strong>  We sweat the small stuff too! Our website favicon cleverly uses three interlocking **Ps** to form a powerful symbol. It's a subtle nod to our brand name, Pure Protein Powders, instantly recognisable to those familiar with our mission.

# SEO Implementation
<details>
Through SEO strategy, I boosted the website's search engine visibility. This involved targeted keyword research, optimised titles and descriptions, and strategic keyword integration within the content itself.

## Keywords
- To ensure my website resonates with my target audience, I conducted an in-depth industry analysis to identify key themes, products, and services that align perfectly with their needs. 
- This included a comprehensive review of competitor websites, allowing me to glean valuable insights into their targeted keywords. 
- By leveraging this knowledge, I was able to refine my own keyword strategy, incorporating both high-volume short-tailed keywords and specific long-tailed keywords to capture a wider range of search queries.

### Targeted Keywords:

- **Short-tail:** I targeted broad terms like "protein powder", "whey protein", "vegan based protein", "muscle building supplements", "workout protein", "post workout protein", "protein for weight loss", "protein shakes", "healthy snacks", "protein bar", "high protein food", "activewear", "workout clothes", "gym clothes", "fitness apparel", "leggings", "workout shorts","tank tops" and "gym hoodies" to capture a wide audience searching for general supplement information.
- **Long-tail:** I also incorporated long-tail keywords like "best protein powder for muscle gain", "protein powder for weight loss for women", "vegan protein powder for athletes", "best protein powder for beginners", "lactose-free protein powder for shakes", "high-protein snacks with protein powder", "protein powder recipes for weight loss", "best protein powder for building lean muscle", "protein powder to boost post-workout recovery", "sweat-wicking workout shirts for men", "affordable yoga clothes for beginners", "stylish activewear sets for women", "moisture-wicking gym shorts for men", "eco-friendly activewear made from recycled materials", "high-intensity training (HIIT) workout clothes", "lightweight breathable hoodie", "breathable tank tops for hot yoga classes" to attract users with defined needs.

### Description Optimisation:

**Meta Tag Integration:** I prioritised crafting compelling meta descriptions that use relevant keywords to introduce our content and entice users to click.
**Content Accuracy:** I maintain flexibility to update descriptions whenever content changes, ensuring they accurately reflect the current page information.

### Dynamic Titles:

**Centralised Control:** My base.html template serves as a central hub for managing page titles, allowing for easy customization for each page.
**SEO Benefits:** This dynamic approach empowers us to optimize titles with relevant keywords, further enhancing my search engine visibility.

### Strategic Keyword Integration:

**Content Harmony:** I strategically weaved my chosen keywords throughout various content elements, including headings (H1 tags), meta data, product names, and descriptions.
**User-Centric Approach:** This integration ensures my content remains not only search-engine friendly but also informative and valuable to my target audience.

**Sitemap**
With a sitemap in place, search engines like Google will be able to more easily discover and index the website's content, improving its search visibility.

- [sitemap.xml](https://github.com/MikesCodingCreations/pp5/blob/main/sitemap.xml)

**Robots.txt**
To ensure Google searches only the most relevant pages, I've implemented access controls, allowing search engines to crawl only specific sections of the website.
